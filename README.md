# sbox-api-template VERSION 1.0
### [OUTDATED]: I do not own this domain anymore, so the demo is outdated. You might try to self host the package but 3 years after the API may have changed. This is more like an archive, have fun anyway.
Demo: https://sharko.app/sbox_api/index

I will try to update the project as the api is updated.

Download this project to have a look on how you can use the s&amp;box backend api.

The backend api documentation can be found here: https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Backend_API

The project uses PHP to call the api and javascript to use the api's result. I tried to make a nice styling but it's not my main quality so it may not be mobile-friendly from the first release.

IMPORTANT: As this project is made for beginners, no framework is used. Pure HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP are used. JQuery, Bootstrap and Google Fonts libraries are also used.

This project is ready to import on your web server and to use! I plan to make a version without PHP soon :)
