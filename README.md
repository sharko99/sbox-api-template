# sbox-api-template
Demo: https://sharko.app/sbox_api/index

I will try to update the project as the api is updated.

Download this project to have a look on how you can use the s&amp;box backend api.

The backend api documentation can be found here: https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Backend_API

The project uses PHP to call the api and javascript to use the api's result. I tried to make a nice styling but it's not my main quality so it may not be mobile-friendly from the first release.

IMPORTANT: As this project is made for beginners, no framework is used. Pure HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP are used. JQuery, Bootstrap and Google Fonts libraries are also used.
